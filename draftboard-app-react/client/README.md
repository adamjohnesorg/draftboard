# NFL Draftboard and Rankings

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was created by Adam Johnes using ReactJS, NodeJS and SCSS.

The objective of this project is to allow the user to create their own NFL player rankings (weekly or otherwise) for both drafting purposes and for illustrating opinions on particular players for a given timeframe.
